# lora-field-security-framework
An encrypted P2P LoRa mesh network and IoT monitoring suite designed for secure field communications and asset protection in cellular-denied environments

Project Overview: 
This suite was developed to address critical communication and security gaps for high-value automotive operations in North American "dead zones". The system leverages 915MHz LoRa technology to provide a decentralized network that functions entirely independent of cellular or internet infrastructure

Key Features:
- Encrypted Mesh Communication:
- Real-Time Asset Monitoring
- Hardware-Based Incident Response
- Optimized Power Management
